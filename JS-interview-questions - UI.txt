// JUNIOR SOFTWARE ENGINEER
{
  Q1: How many data types in javascript?
  Ans: 
      Primitives data types: String, Boolean, Number etc
      Non-primitive: Arrays and Objects

  Q2: What is Hoisting in javascript?    Yes
  Ans: JavaScript's default behavior of moving all declarations to the top of the current scope

  Q3: What are callbacks?
  Ans: A callback is a function that will be executed after another function gets executed. Callback is basically used in asynchronous operations.

  Q4: Is javascript a statically typed or a dynamically typed language?
  Ans: JavaScript is a dynamically typed language. In a dynamically typed language, the type of a variable is checked during run-time in contrast to a statically typed language, where the type of a variable is checked during compile-time.

  Q5: Explain passed by value and passed by reference?
  Ans: Primitive data types when passed to another variable, are passed by value (only value is transfered) whereas Non-Primitives data types passes the location to another variable where that value is actually stored.

  Q6: What is an Immediately Invoked Function in JavaScript?
  Ans: An Immediately Invoked Function ( known as IIFE) is a function that runs as soon as it is defined.

  Q7: Explain Higher Order Functions in javascript?
  Ans: Functions that operate on other functions, either by taking them as arguments or by returning them, are called higher-order functions.

  Q8: What are object prototypes?
  Ans: A prototype is a blueprint of an object. The prototype allows us to use properties and methods on an object even if the properties and methods do not exist on the current object.

  Q9: What is memoization?
  Ans: Memoization is a form of caching where the return value of a function is cached based on its parameters. If the parameter of that function is not changed, the cached version of the function is returned.

  Q10: What is recursion and how it is usesul?
  Ans: Recursion is a technique to iterate over an operation by having a function call itself repeatedly until it arrives at a result. It reduces the code and complexity.

  Q11: How comfortable are you in CSS? Have you ever worked on any CSS framework like Bootstrap, tailwind css, Kendo UI etc?
  Ans: Candidate needs to explain how we can write our own custom css. In real world project for the sake of time & fast development we use CSS frameworks (follow up questions).

// SOFTWARE ENGINEER
{
  Q1: What are closures (and some follow up questions on this)?
  Ans: Closures are an ability of a function to remember the variables and functions that are declared in its outer scope.
      Note: This is a wide concept and can not be explained in less words.

  Q2: Explain debouncing in detail?
  Ans: Debouncing is a programming practice used to ensure that time-consuming tasks do not fire so often, that it stalls the performance of the web page.
      It exucutes the function after a specific time interval after the last event occured.

  Q3: What are promises? How it helps in asynchronous programming.
  Ans: Promises are basically tools to deal with asynchronous operations. It removes callback hell issue (and some follow up questions on it).

  Q4: Practical task: We have a button on page. Count how many times the button have been clicked?
  Ans: use closure concept to keep track of button clicked (checking core concepts knowledge in JS).

  Q5: What is currying and it core usage?
  Ans: Currying in JavaScript transforms a function with multiple arguments into a nested series of functions, each taking a single argument. (some follow up questions, probably some practical tasks on this concept).

  Q6: Expalin binary search? How it is useful in searching mechanism? Time & Space Complexity.
  Ans: This is a optimised searching technique also called divide and conquer approach. In this technique on every repetition we discard half of record length.

  Q7: Practical task: How can we create custom event emitter?
  Ans: Candidate needs to write code. He needs to create a Event emitter class & should have on, emit, removeListeners functions etc.

  Q8: Practical task: Write polyfill for Array.prototype.bind() function?
  Ans: Candidate needs to write code.

  Q9: Prototypal inheritance in JS and its basic implementation.
  Ans: Inheritance refers to passing down characteristics from a parent to a child so that a new piece of code can reuse and build upon the features of an existing one. JavaScript implements inheritance by using objects (some follow up questions).

  Q10: REACT JS: Explain state management library - Redux or Context API
  Ans: Redux and Context API are both used to manage application state. Context API can be used in small-medium apps whereas Redux can be used in large applications.

  Q11: REACT JS: Difference between useMemo & useCallback hooks?
  Ans: 
      useMemo - It caches the return value of a function.
      useCallback: It prevents the function from being initializing again & again(few followup questions).

// SENIOR SOFTWARE ENGINEER
{
    Senior Software Engineer should know all the basic stuff mentioned above. In addition to that he/she should be well versed in advance JS concepts like:
  1) Images - 
      - Compression
      - Lazy Loading
      - Progressive Enhancement
      - Client HTTP hint
      - Responsive Images
  2) Videos -
      - Progressive Enhancement
      - Streaming
      - Videos with no audio
      - Preload
  3) Fonts - 
      - Font display decorator
      - Flout with class
      - Async Load CSS
      - Font face observer
  4) CSS - 
      - Lazy Loading
      - Critical CSS Rendering
  5) JavaScript - 
      - defer vs async => 
      - Web Worker
      - Lazy Loading

  Questions::

  Q1: Explain critical rendering path?
  Ans: The Critical Rendering Path is the sequence of steps the browser goes through to convert the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript into pixels on the screen (CSSOM, DOM etc)

  Q2: Practical task - Write your own Promise constructor?
  Ans: Candidate needs to write code (some follow up questions)

  Q3: How generator function works & how they are related to Promises? Explain with example!
  Ans: They allow you to define an iterative algorithm by writing a single function whose execution is not continuous. Candidate need to write custom implementation.

  Solid Principles: No
  Q4: Design pattern - Facade & Builder pattern? 
  Ans: 
      Facade - The Façade pattern provides an interface which shields clients from complex functionality in one or more subsystems.
      Builder - The Builder pattern allows a client to construct a complex object by specifying the type and content only. Construction details are hidden from the client entirely.

  Q5: How will you design a Autocomplete functionality? implement in vanilla JS.
  Ans: To complete this functionality, we need to call an api for results and show them in dropdown. 
      Dropdown should be searchable & can filter records accordingly.
      We can use debouncing technique to reduce the api calls on every keystroke.

  Q6: How service worker works & how they can be useful for application?
  Ans: Service workers essentially act as proxy servers that sit between web applications, the browser, and the network (when available).

  Q7: Application optimizing techniques in detail?
  Ans: Optimze images sizes, CDN, caching, treeshaking, code splitting etc.

  Q8: What are the security aspects required to build a secure web app? Explain few points.
  Ans: OWASP 10 principles, encrypt the code, using Latest Cryptography Techniques, high level authentication, compromised passwords etc.

  Q9: How V8 engine works? High level overview!
  Ans: This question needs high level understanding of Javascript under the hood.
      - It uses Mark & Sweep Algorithm.
      - Interpreter Name => Ignition [working under the hood]
      - Compiler => TurboFan
      - Orinoco => Garbage Collector

  Q10: How event loop works in detail? What is the role of execution context?
  Ans: It includes Micro process queue, Macro queue, call stack & execution context.

  Q11: Difference between Promises & Observable?
  Ans: Both are used to deal with asynchronous operations.
      Observables are cancellable but promises are not.
      There are lot of difference between them, candidate should have deep understanding on this.

  Q12: Architecture: How will you setup React application from scratch?
  Ans: We can use create-react-app or any bundling tool like Vite or Parcel.

  Q13: Angular vs React & why?
  Ans: Candidate needs to explain from each & every apects of both. Props & Cons in detail.
